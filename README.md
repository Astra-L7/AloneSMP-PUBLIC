# How to install / edit

Before you start editing this repo make sure when you are to export 
this datapack into minecraft for testing,
make sure you compress (turn into a .zip file)
all of the files within the folder "SOURCE CODE".

# STEPS

1. Delete this .txt file it WILL interfere with the game code and it will NOT work. (You can make a backup somewhere else)
2. Zip the contents of the folder called "SOURCE CODE". Do NOT zip the folder itself, but zip the stuff inside of the folder.

## IF YOU ARE CREATING A FRESH WORLD

3. If you are creating a world in 1.20 or newer, click on the "DATAPACKS" menu and you can drag the newly made .zip file into the datapack temp folder.
4. Create the world and test the datapack!

## IF YOU ARE PUTTING THE DATAPACK IN AN EXISTING WORLD

3. Drag the newly made .zip file in to the "datapacks" within your world folder. (See the bottom on how to access the world file)
4. Use /reload in the game and the datapack will load.
